Hopfield Network Implementation in MATLAB

This repository contains the code and files for implementing a Hopfield network in MATLAB. The Hopfield network is a recurrent neural network used for content-addressable memory and pattern recognition. In this implementation, we'll explore the fundamentals of Hopfield networks and demonstrate their capabilities using a simple example.

# Hopfield Network Architecture

The Hopfield network consists of neurons that interact through weighted connections. In our implementation:

    Weight Matrix Initialization: We calculate the weight matrix based on the outer product of the input patterns.

    Energy Computation: We compute the energy of the network using the Hopfield energy function.

    Activation Update: Neurons are updated asynchronously using an iterative process.
    
# Conclusion
